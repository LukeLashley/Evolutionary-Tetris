# Evolutionary-Tetris
This was a project I threw together for one of my classes - I was very limited on time, so there a re alot of features I would love to eventually implement:
* This project still needs to be properly commented.
* As well, I need to implement saving the generations - as it takes a very long time to get good results and it would be nice to start from a specific generation.
* Finally, I need to implement workers. As right now it runs one game at a time for each child in the population. Each child plays 10 games, and there are 150 children.

To start:
1. Open index.html
2. Open console to watch progress
3. Wait a long time.
